Just a basic search engine. 

1. Persistent Storage has all the scripts related to extracting the links, then scraping the data and finally writing it to disk. The corresponding python scripts inside the folders are self explanatory. 

2. Advanced_Search_Engine is a biased search engine and assigns more score to some particular terms if they appear in the query. 

3. Data Processing handles the normalization of text and other standard cleaning procedures like toeknization, stemming, and others. 

4. Search Engine deals with the creation of inverted index, query processing and cosine similarity matching between the query and other documents based on TF-IDF scores. 


Note: This is just a basic search engine and it will be improved a lotttttt soon.
